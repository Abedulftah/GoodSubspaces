- **Lecturer**: Dan Feldman
- **Students**: Abed Alftah, Fadi Hallaso

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

We aim to solve efficient subspace approximation problems.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To run the algorithm, you need to:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/optimization-ml.git
   cd optimization-ml

   ```

2. Install the required dependency:
   pip install numpy
   pip install scipy
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install imageio

3. To run the algorithm with testing and plotting, execute the main script:
   python main.py
